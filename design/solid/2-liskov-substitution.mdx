# Liskov Substitution

The Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP) is one of the SOLID principles of object-oriented design, introduced by Barbara Liskov. LSP emphasizes the importance of maintaining compatibility between base and derived classes, asserting that objects of a superclass should be replaceable with objects of a subclass without affecting the correctness of the program.

Key principles of the Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP):

1. **Substitutability:**
   - Objects of a base class should be easily replaceable with objects of a derived class without altering the correctness of the program.
   - Code that relies on a base class should be able to work seamlessly with objects of any derived class.

2. **Behavioral Compatibility:**
   - Derived classes should extend the behavior of the base class without altering its original behavior.
   - If a client code works with a base class, it should continue to work correctly when provided with an instance of any derived class.

3. **Avoidance of Stronger Preconditions:**
   - Subclasses should not impose stronger preconditions (i.e., more restrictive requirements) than those imposed by the base class.
   - Derived classes should honor the contracts established by the base class.

4. **Preservation of Invariants:**
   - Invariants (properties or conditions that remain true) established by the base class should be preserved by the derived class.
   - A subclass should not violate the assumptions made by the code working with its base class.

5. **Exception Handling:**
   - Exceptions thrown by methods in a derived class should be compatible with those thrown by methods in the base class.
   - Clients should not be surprised by unexpected exceptions when substituting objects.

**Example:**

Consider a scenario where you have a `Bird` class and a `Penguin` class derived from it. If the `Bird` class has a method `fly()`, adhering to LSP means that calling `fly()` on an instance of `Penguin` should not cause issues, even though penguins cannot fly.

```python
class Bird:
    def fly(self):
        pass

class Penguin(Bird):
    # Penguins cannot fly, but they can swim
    def swim(self):
        pass
```

In this example, the `Penguin` class doesn't implement the `fly()` method, which is acceptable according to LSP. Clients using a `Bird` object, expecting it to fly, can still work with a `Penguin` object without encountering unexpected errors. The key is that the derived class doesn't violate the expected behavior established by the base class.
