## Welcome to this place

Frontend Garage is like my personal archive where I share stuff about things I'm learning.

On this website you will find content about the foundamentals of Sotware Engineering. I think it is very
important as Software Engineers to know these concepts and how to apply them.

> Anyone can make Software but not everyone can make good software.

I hope you enjoy and learn with me!
